# Petition

Spiced Academy: Petition Project

I built this website to study Handlebars, Express and to get more familiar with Node.js.
The petition is loosely based on mental health awareness, as I come from the field of Psychology and because I am a mental health advocate. A lot of the text is Lorem ipsum because the website is intended to be used for demo purposes.
This project was also pushed to Heroku.

Technologies/packages used: Handlebars, Express, Node, Postgres, Heroku.
